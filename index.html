        <h2>Why Do People Add Pronouns to Their Signature Line?</h2>
        <div class="content-grid">
          <div class="text-content">
            <p>Typically, society has taught us to make automatic assumptions about what pronouns to use for someone. If a person's gender expression (the way they appear in terms of gender) seems to be masculine, we'd likely use he/him/his when talking about that person; if a person's appearance seems to be feminine, we'd be likely to use she/her/hers.</p>
            
            <p>However, gender is not always that simple. Sometimes a person's gender doesn't align with their gender expression (the way they look). In addition, not everyone expresses themselves strictly masculine or feminine.</p>
            
            <p>When a person includes their gender pronouns on their email signature line (or on a nametag, when introducing themselves, etc.), they are simply taking the guesswork away for you! It's their way of saying "when you refer to me using pronouns (opposed to by my name), these are the pronouns I'd like for you to use."</p>
            
            <p>Sharing pronouns helps reduce instances of misgendering, which can be distressing and harmful to all individuals, but particularly those who are trans or non-binary.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Gender Pronouns</h2>
        
        <div class="card">
          <h3>If someone states their pronouns, does it mean they are transgender?</h3>
          <p>Not at all. Everyone has a gender, and most of us have specific pronouns we'd like people to use when we are being referred to. Sharing pronouns doesn't automatically mean a person is transgender or gender non-conforming.</p>
          <p>Even if you are not someone whose pronouns are often misidentified, sharing your pronouns can set a positive example and support those who might feel more vulnerable about their gender identity.</p>

              <li>The American Psychological Association recommends using gender-inclusive language in all professional communications</li>
              <li>Many major companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Apple, encourage employees to include pronouns in their email signatures</li>
