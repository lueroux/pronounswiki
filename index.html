Understanding the correct usage of gender-inclusive pronouns promotes respect and supports gender identity, especially for transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming individuals.<p>Examples of pronouns you might use to refer to others are:<ul><li><a href=/she class=internal-link>she/her/hers</a> (for someone who might be female or feminine),<li><a href=/he class=internal-link>he/him/his</a> (for someone who might be male or masculine),<li><a href=/they class=internal-link>they/them/theirs</a> (for someone who might not identify strictly as male or female).<li><a href=/neopronouns class=internal-link>ze/zir/zirs</a> (an example of neopronouns, also for someone who might not identify strictly as male or female).</ul></section><h2>Why Do People Add Pronouns to Their Signature Line?</h2><p>Typically, society has taught us to make automatic assumptions about what pronouns to use for someone. If a person’s gender expression (the way they appear in terms of gender) seems to be masculine, we’d likely use he/him/his when talking about that person; if a person’s appearance seems to be feminine, we’d be likely to use she/her/hers. However, gender is not always that simple. Sometimes a person’s gender doesn’t align with their gender expression (the way they look). In addition, not everyone expresses themselves strictly masculine or feminine. So when a person includes their gender pronouns on their email signature line (or on a nametag, when introducing themselves, etc.), they are simply taking the guesswork away for you! It’s their way of saying “when you refer to me using pronouns (opposed to by my name), these are the pronouns I’d like for you to use.”<br>Sharing pronouns helps reduce instances of misgendering, which can be distressing and harmful to all individuals, but particularly those who are trans or non-binary.<br><br><button id=openModalBtn style=text-decoration:underline>If you need help creating a new email signature, we have a free to use generator available.</button><section><h2>If someone feels the need to state their pronouns, does it mean they are transgender, gender non-conforming, or intersex?</h2><p>Not at all. Everyone has a gender, and most of us have specific pronouns we’d like people to use when we are being referred to. Some might ask: Isn’t it typically obvious what pronouns to use for a person? (For instance, if someone has a typically ‘feminine’ name and looks ‘female,’ then can’t one assume that person identifies as female and would want to be referred to with she/her/hers pronouns?) To answer that question, yes, most of us are privileged in that when someone guesses our pronouns, they’ll get them right. However, that’s not the case for everyone. Oftentimes this might be because a person is gender non-conforming (where they don’t clearly conform to ‘traditional’ male or female standards) or are openly gender-queer (which might also leave some unsure which pronouns to use). With that said, if someone decides to tell you their pronouns, it does not automatically mean they are transgender or gender non-conforming.<br>Even if you are not someone whose pronouns are often misidentified, sharing your pronouns can set a positive example and support those who might feel more vulnerable about their gender identity.</section><section><h2>Glossary</h2><ul><li><a href=https://glaad.org/transgender/transfaq/ aria-label="Link to Transgender FAQ on GLAAD website"target=_blank rel=noopener>Transgender</a> / Trans - an umbrella term that describes people whose gender identity does not match the sex they were assigned at birth.<li><a href=https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender aria-label="Link to Non-binary gender article on Simple Wikipedia"target=_blank rel=noopener>Non-binary</a> - a spectrum of gender identities that are not exclusively masculine or feminine.<li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex aria-label="Link to Intersex article on Wikipedia"target=_blank rel=noopener>Intersex</a> - people who have variations in sex characteristics. <a href=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12476264/ aria-label="Link to PubMed article on Intersex traits"target=_blank>According to experts, around 1.7% of the population is born with intersex traits</a> – comparable to the number of people born with red hair.<li><a href=https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Agender aria-label="Link to Agender article on Gender Wiki"target=_blank rel=noopener>Agender</a> - Agender is a gender identity generally defined as in which one lacks a gender or has very little experience of a gender.<li><a href=https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisgender aria-label="Link to Cisgender article on Simple Wikipedia"target=_blank rel=noopener>Cisgender</a> - A term for people whose gender matches the sex they were assigned at birth.<li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_expression aria-label="Link to Gender Expression article on Wikipedia"target=_blank rel=noopener>Gender Expression</a> - The external display of one's gender, through a combination of dress, demeanor, social behavior, and other factors.<li><a href=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/LGBTQ-equality/gender-identity-beginners-guide-trans-allies aria-label="Link to Gender Identity article on Amnesty International website"target=_blank rel=noopener>Gender / Gender Identity</a> - One’s internal sense of being male, female, both, neither, or somewhere along the gender spectrum.<li><a href=https://www.healthline.com/health/transgender/misgendering#why-it-happens aria-label="Link to Misgendering article on Healthline"target=_blank rel=noopener>Misgendering</a> - Referring to someone, especially a transgender person, using a word, especially a pronoun or form of address, that does not correctly reflect their gender.<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadnaming#:~:text=Deadnaming%20is%20the%20act%20of,invalidate%20a%20person's%20gender%20identity."aria-label="Link to Deadnaming article on Wikipedia"target=_blank rel=noopener>Deadnaming</a> - The act of referring to someone, but usually a trans person, by their birth name instead of their chosen name.<li><a href=https://www.them.us/story/what-does-queer-mean aria-label="Link to Queer article on Them"target=_blank rel=noopener>Queer</a> - An umbrella term used to describe a wide range of sexual & romantic orientations, gender identities, and gender expressions.</ul></section><hr><footer><p style=font-size:1em;color:#505050>Feel free to share this page by including the link next to your pronouns in your email signature.
