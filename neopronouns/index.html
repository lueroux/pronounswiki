<p>Neopronouns (or neo-pronouns) are a growing topic of interest, especially as more people explore different ways to express their identity. If you’re new to the idea of neopronouns or just curious to learn more, this guide will help break it down in a simple, easy-to-understand way.</p>

<h2>What Are Neopronouns?</h2>

<p>In simple terms, neopronouns are any pronouns other than “he,” “she,” or “they.” They’re used as an alternative to traditional pronouns and often serve as a way for people to express their identity, especially if they feel that traditional pronouns don’t quite fit them.</p>

<p>Some examples of neopronouns include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>ze/zir/zirs</li>
    <li>xe/xem/xyr</li>
    <li>thon/thonself</li>
</ul>

<p>These pronouns might seem unfamiliar at first, but they work just like any other pronoun in a sentence.</p>

<h2>Why Do People Use Neopronouns?</h2>

<p>People choose to use neopronouns for a variety of reasons, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Avoiding Confusion:</strong> Some people prefer neopronouns to avoid confusion with “they/them,” which is commonly used both as a singular and plural pronoun.</li>
    <li><strong>Expressing Identity:</strong> For people who identify with genders outside the male-female binary (like xenogenders), neopronouns can better reflect how they see themselves.</li>
    <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> Some simply feel more comfortable with neopronouns because they don’t connect to traditional gender expectations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, pronouns don’t always equal gender identity. A non-binary person might still use “he/him,” while a genderfluid person might go by “they/she.” It’s all about personal choice and comfort.</p>

<h2>Are Neopronouns New?</h2>

<p>While neopronouns might seem like a modern trend, they’ve actually been around for quite a while. For example, one of the oldest recorded neopronouns is “thon” (short for “that one”), created in 1858 by American composer Charles Crosby Converse. Though not widely used today, it shows that creating new pronouns is not a new concept.</p>

<h2>How to Use Neopronouns</h2>

<p>Using neopronouns is similar to using any other pronoun. Let’s take a look at a sentence example using the neopronoun ze/zir:</p>

<ul>
    <li>“This is Alex. Ze left zir coat at the café, so I’m holding onto it for zir.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Some people may use multiple neopronouns and alternate between them. For example, someone might use bee/it/they pronouns like this:</p>

<ul>
    <li>“This is Alex. Bee thinks it left its jacket at the party, so they are going back to look for it.”</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s important to respect how someone wants to be referred to, and practice will help you get used to using neopronouns correctly.</p>

<h2>Neopronouns and Language</h2>

<p>A common argument against neopronouns is that they’re not part of the English language. But just like how new words (like “emoji”) have been added to our vocabulary over time, language is constantly evolving. Neopronouns are a valid part of this evolution. People have been creating new pronouns for centuries, and as society becomes more inclusive, language adapts with it.</p>

<h2>What About People Who Don’t Use Pronouns?</h2>

<p>Some people prefer not to use pronouns at all. Instead, they might ask you to use their name in place of a pronoun. For example:</p>

<ul>
    <li>“This is Charli’s book. Charli left it at the park.”</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Neopronouns are any pronouns outside of he/she/they, and they help people express their identity in ways that feel right for them.</li>
    <li>Pronouns don’t define gender. Anyone can use any pronouns they feel comfortable with.</li>
    <li>Neopronouns have been around for over 200 years and are a valid part of the English language.</li>
    <li>Respecting someone’s chosen pronouns is important, whether they use traditional pronouns, neopronouns, or no pronouns at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re ever unsure about someone’s pronouns, the best thing to do is ask! It’s a small but meaningful way to show respect.</p>
