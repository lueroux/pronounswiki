        <h1>Understanding Consent</h1>

        <section class="glass-card">
            <h2>What is Consent?</h2>
            <p>Consent is a fundamental aspect of respectful, safe, and positive interactions. It involves clear, voluntary, and authentic agreement between all parties involved in any activity or interaction. Whether in personal relationships, workplace interactions, or daily social encounters, respecting consent helps build trust and creates environments where everyone feels valued and secure.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="glass-card">
            <h2>Consent must be Authentic, Informed, and Explicit</h2>
            <p>There are many different definitions and models of consent, but Affirmative Consent is the one we prefer. Affirmative Consent is defined as:</p>
            <blockquote>“An informed, authentic and explicit agreement, freely given between two legal adults in a non-altered state of mind to allow a specific set of activities to happen during a specific time frame.”</blockquote>
            <p>Every word in that definition is important.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Informed:</strong> You must know what you are agreeing to and the possible risks and implications you are exposing yourself to. Education on and an understanding of the activity being negotiated are critical to being able to give informed consent. If you don't understand the potential risks and implications of an activity, how can you authentically state that you accept those risks? Whether you are the giver or receiver in an activity, it is your responsibility to inform yourself and ask for specificity. Without knowledge, you are not informed.</li>
                <li><strong>Authentic:</strong> This means you are actively interested and wanting to participate in the activities proposed. Some people like to use the phrase "enthusiastic consent" because when someone is into something, that is often expressed with enthusiasm. However, we prefer the term "authentic" because not everyone displays enthusiasm, due to introversion and neurodivergence. Conversely, enthusiasm is sometimes a masking technique or a PTSD reaction and isn't what the person really wants to express. To be authentic, an agreement must be informed, explicit and freely given.</li>
                <li><strong>Explicit:</strong> All people involved have a clear understanding of all the activities being proposed and all clearly state that they agree to take part in those activities. No assumptions. No implications. No innuendos.</li>
                <li><strong>Freely Given:</strong> Consent is only valid if it is freely given and with no coercion; be it physical, emotional, social, psychological, or chemical (drugs or alcohol). These things also impact a person's ability to be authentic as authentic consent means pressure free and non-coerced.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Adult:</strong> Any person who is not a legal adult in the jurisdiction in which an activity is taking place cannot legally consent to any sexual activity or activity related to sex.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Altered State of Mind:</strong> A person under the influence of any mind-altering influence or substance cannot consent to anything, even if they agreed to it. A person who is asleep, or under the influence of drugs or alcohol cannot consent. This also includes the altered states of subspace or hypnosis - consent must happen before we start activities that lead to those mind altering states. In addition, some people find that being in a space such as a sex club or dungeon to be mind-altering and so it is advisable to negotiate before arriving.</li>
                <li><strong>Specific Set of Activities:</strong> Be specific as to what activities the negotiated scene will include. Consent to one type of sexual contact does not mean consent has been given for any other type of sexual contact. Do not include any activity that you did not specifically and clearly include in the negotiation before the scene.</li>
                <li><strong>Time Specific:</strong> Just because someone consented to something yesterday does not mean you get to do that same thing again today or ever. Consent is not ongoing and is retractable and revocable at any time. Any wish to 'do that again' needs further negotiation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is also useful to consider the following as good practices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remember that consent and negotiation isn't just applicable to sexual encounters; it is important in our everyday lives and can make a difference to all of our encounters. Asking what food someone would prefer to eat or asking permission before joining a conversation or before hugging someone are all types of negotiation and consent!</li>
                <li>Any activity agreed on must receive Explicit Prior Permission verbally rather than through implied consent, gestures, body language or past behaviour.</li>
                <li>Informed consent requires a discussion of any risks. These should include risks due to fluid exchange, potential injury or because of health conditions. If practicing kink or BDSM play you should also discuss your experience, technique and proficiency.</li>
                <li>Everyone should fully understand both the desires and the boundaries of the other participants in order for everyone to consent to them. What parts of the body are off limits? What is the desired outcome for the scene? Who will be involved?</li>
                <li>Everyone is free to withdraw their negotiated consent at any time during the activity without any need for explanation or justification. No is a complete sentence.</li>
                <li>Everyone should have an agreed safeword or signal and you should check in regularly with your partner(s) throughout a negotiated scene. Be aware that solely relying on safewords can be problematic – people may lose the ability to speak due to endorphins, over or under stimulation, etc. Having an agreed body or eye movement in addition to the safeword is recommended. Body language and eyes can also tell you a lot about someone's capacity to continue.</li>
                <li>Be honest. Informed consent includes being aware of limitations and barriers to the ability to consent to the planned activities. You should always disclose your experience level, age, medical conditions, potential triggers, energy levels and use of drugs or alcohol prior to play.</li>
                <li>You are free to reject any activities that were previously agreed to during play or a scene. Changing your mind at any time is completely acceptable.</li>
                <li>Serious lasting bodily injury cannot legally be consented to.</li>
                <li>Sexual Assault is defined as anything that was not specifically given informed consent.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Consent Beyond Sexual Activity</h2>
            <p>Consent applies broadly to many aspects of life beyond sexual encounters:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Everyday interactions:</strong> Asking permission before physical contact such as hugging or shaking hands, or before entering personal conversations.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional settings:</strong> Always obtaining consent before sharing personal information, taking or sharing photographs, or involving colleagues in discussions or activities that might impact their comfort or privacy.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="glass-card">
            <h2>Best Practices for Consent</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Explicit Verbal Permission:</strong> Always seek explicit verbal agreement, avoiding reliance solely on body language or previous interactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Discuss Risks and Boundaries:</strong> Clearly communicate about any potential physical or emotional risks. This includes health concerns, triggers, or personal limitations.</li>
                <li><strong>Ongoing Communication:</strong> Continuously check in throughout any activity or interaction. Consent can be withdrawn at any moment without explanation.</li>
                <li><strong>Safewords and Signals:</strong> In certain activities (e.g., kink or BDSM), establish clear safewords or non-verbal signals since participants may become unable to communicate verbally.</li>
                <li><strong>Honesty and Transparency:</strong> Share openly about your experience, limitations, health conditions, emotional state, and other factors that could affect consent.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Withdraw:</strong> You always have the right to change your mind and withdraw previously given consent.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal and Ethical Limits:</strong> Certain activities, particularly those that may cause serious bodily harm, cannot be legally consented to.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Importance of Consent</h2>
            <p>Creating a culture of consent fosters trust, respect, and emotional safety in all relationships and interactions. It supports a healthy, inclusive, and respectful environment, both in professional settings and personal lives.</p>
            <p>Respecting and practicing authentic, informed, explicit, and freely given consent is essential in building positive interpersonal relationships and inclusive workplaces.</p>
